    <h2>What is SimpleTalk?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>SimpleTalk is a purely text-based social media web app that allow users to create posts for others to view.<br>
      The text within the post could be status updates, stories, or anything else they would like to share. Users can<br>
      share links, but all links shared on the app will assure the user of the final destination before redirecting,<br>
      helping users stay more secure. Users will have the ability to subscribe to other users to consistently view posts<br>
      from other creators.<br>
      <br>
      The text font, color, and background will be customizable for every post; allowing users to add some artistic<br>
      flare to everything they would like to share. Posts are unlimited, and users that consistently post will be<br>
      rewarded with additional options for customization. All posts will have the ability to be edited or deleted after<br>
      posting.</p>
